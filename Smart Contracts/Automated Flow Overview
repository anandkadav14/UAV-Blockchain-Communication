7. Automated Flow Overview

1. Drone Registration: The drone is registered using the DroneIdentification contract.
2. Drone Takeoff/Landing: The flight operations are managed via the DroneFlight contract, ensuring only registered drones can take off and land.
3. Logging: The DroneCommLog contract records key events, such as takeoff and landing, in an immutable log.
4. Automation: By running `automation.js`, the entire process is automated for fast execution during your demonstration.
